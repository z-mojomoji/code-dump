                        <p>Mozzo was founded in 2014 as a result of the simple business observation that technology can be used to transform and improve efficiency of service delivery. The Mozzo product has been developed by a group of individuals, in consultation with key industry stakeholders, with the belief and drive to develop a system to revolutionise and change the face of workforce management. The system works to efficiently close the information loop between contractors/service providers, management agents and the end consumer/clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mozzo is a powerful and easy to use cloud based, universal field contractor management platform. The software comprises a management console and a phone based application. The software has been designed using state-of-the-art technology with a scalable modular design. This modular design has ensured that the software can be portable and adaptable across all vertical markets (industries). For companies with multiple contractors that have difficultly tracking, scheduling, or delivering goods or services, the Mozzo solution will achieve this aim with ease. The product value is delivered to contractors, clients and customers with higher levels of interaction and continual live feedback.  
                        </p>
			<p>The centralised platform bridges the communication and reporting gaps between all aspects of job scheduling, sequencing and organising multiple personnel assets. The system is designed around a set of processes to control and allocate work orders and tasks via a proven set of supply chain technology. 
			</p>
			<p>Our team are big believers in the power of keeping the design simple and flexible and make it simple for your organisation to create, schedule and manage your tasks online.
